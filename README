Virtual FIDO U2F Token Chrome Extension
=======================================

A full JavaScript implementation of a virtual [FIDO U2F](http://fidoalliance.org/specifications/download/) token and a JavaScript API to conveniently access it.

Objective
-----------

This extension does three things:

 1. It provides a high level JavaScript API by adding a `window.u2f` object to every page opened in Chrome, similar to Google's [u2f-chrome-extension](https://github.com/google/u2f-ref-code/tree/master/u2f-chrome-extension). This allows websites to access the `window.u2f.register` and `window.u2f.sign` methods.
 2. It provides a user interface, listing tokens and allowing to perform a user presence check by clicking a button.
 3. It provides a JavaScript implementation of a token that emmits messages as specified in [FIDO U2F Raw Message Formats](http://fidoalliance.org/specs/fido-u2f-raw-message-formats-v1.0-rd-20140209.pdf).

Installation
------------

 1. Download and extract the extension to a directory of your choice.
 2. Open Google Chrome's extension manager by opening `chrome://extensions/` or chose *Menu > Settings > Extensions* in the chrome UI.
 3. Make sure *Developer Mode* is checked in the upper right hand corner.
 4. Choose *Load Unpacked Extension*
 5. Navigate to the directory of the downloaded extension. And click *open*.
 6. You should now see *Virtual FIDO U2F Token Extension* in the list of extensions.

Configuration
-------------

#### Make Extension Externally Connectable

For security reasons, in the Chrome extension system you have to manually specify web pages that can talk to an extension. If the domain is not in the list of connectable locations, the extension will fail silently. By default the extension is configured to only be connectable by http connections from 127.0.0.1 (this excludes `localhost`). To add other locations you need to open `manifest.json` from the extensions folder in a text editor. Locate the following lines:

```
	"externally_connectable": {
		"matches": [
			"http://127.0.0.1/*"
		]
	},
```

Here, you can add web pages where the extension should run. For format and allowed wild cards consult the [Chrome extension documentation](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/manifest/externally_connectable).

Say, you wanted to be able to connect to the extension through all protocols and from all subdomains of your domain example.org. To achieve this you would edit the list of externally connectable locations like that:

```
	"externally_connectable": {
		"matches": [
			"http://127.0.0.1/*",
			"*://*.example.org/*"
		]
	},
```

After editing the manifest you need to relaod the extension by choosing *reload* in `chrome://extensions/`.

Usage
-----

After installation and configuration you will be able to use the extension as a virtual U2F token. It comes with a little visual user interface that shows what would normally be stored internally. It is hidden under the *FIDO U2F Simulation* button (the tiny USB stick icon with blue and red lines). Click this button to bring up the user interface.

It will expose the following details of your virtual token:

 * The X.509 signature certificate (as DER in hexadecimal format)
 * The private attestation key (this of course would never be exposed with a hardware device and is only shown for debugging)
 * The public attestation key

The following information is displayed for every key generated:

 * The key handle
 * The key generatiohn time
 * The app ID
 * The public (user) key
 * The private (user) key
 * The current number of the authentication counter

Much like the real deal, this extension only provides a single way of user interaction: The user presence test. It is performed by clicking the *Simulate Touch* button.

You can use this interface just like you would use a real hardware token.
Whenever a web application asks you to touch you device to either sign in or register, simply press the *Simulate Touch* button. The extension will mimic the response a regular FIDO hardware token would give and will expose the internal of the keystore to you in the user interface.

To Do
-----

 * **Implement Authentication**
 * At the moment only the first element of an array of sign requests is used.
 * `fido-u2f-javascript-api-v1.0-rd-20140209.pdf` states that "Additionally, it [the RP] should prepare SignData objects for each U2F token that the user has already registered with the RP (see below) and then call handleRegistrationRequest on a CryptoTokenHandler object." This is ignored so far.
 * There is no check whether a facet id is allowed for an app id yet.

Virtual FIDO U2F Token Chrome Extension
=======================================

Extension Configuration
-----------------------

### Make Extension Externally Connectable

Edit `externally_connectable` in `manifest.json` to include the domain the script should be running on.
Proceed according to [the Chrome extension documentation](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/manifest/externally_connectable).
If the domain is not in the list of connectable locations, the extension will fail silently.
